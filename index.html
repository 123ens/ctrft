                        <p></p>
                        <p>To The Elders And Churches Of Whom God Has Called By His Great Grace And Mercy This Day, To Fulfil The Pattern Of Another Ephesian And Thessalonian Type Church In This Hour.</p>
                        <p>To You All, His Very Elect, I Write These Few Words Of Exhortation, For Your Edification And Encouragement At The Dawning Of This New Year.</p>
                        <p>I Thank God For You All, And For Keeping Us In The Ranks Of The Faithful And In His Glorious Light.</p>
                        <p>For It Is Indeed Grace To See, And To Walk-In The Light Of This Seven Thunder Message. Thanks Be To Him, For Ever And Ever.</p>
                        <p>It Is My Hope And Prayer That Each Of You Has Grown This Past Year With Some Degree In Your Understanding, Wisdom, And Maturity, For This Is The Hope Of All That Care For The Flock Of God.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>We Are Admonished By God’s Servant To Stay In The Presence Of The Sonlight To Be Ripened – To Mature. Let Us Therefore Do Nothing To Cover, Obstruct Or Diminish The Sonlight In Anyway, For This Will Have An Effect Upon Us And Our Neighbors.</p>
                        <p>I Will Like At This Moment, To Join My Voice With The Wise Solomon Who Instructed Us In Proverbs 22:28 To - Remove Not The Ancient Landmark, Which Thy Fathers Have Set.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>The Hebrew Word “ Set” Conveys The Meaning That The Fathers Labored [Pressed - Sacrificed] In Full Service And Dedication Even At The Risk To Their Own Lives, To Place These Landmarks For The Well-Being Of God’s Elect. –</p>
                        <p>To Remove Or Change These Divinely Set Landmarks, Is To Disrespect – To Dishonor – And To Show Open Rebellion Towards The God Who Called And Send Them To Set These Landmarks In Order</p>
                        <p>The Hebrew Word “Landmark” Comes From The Root Word Gabal {Gaw-Bal'}
                        <ul>
                        <li>1 To Set Bounds, Set Bounds For</li>	
                        <li>To bound, Border Hebrew Lexicon -- Strong's Number 1366</li>
                        <li> Gbuwl	1 Border, Territory</li>
                        <li>1a Border	<br>1b Territory (Enclosed Within Boundary) <br>1c Region, Territory (Of Darkness) </li>(Figurative)</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>So, The Book Of Wisdom Admonishes Us Not To Remove The Ancient Landmarks Which Our Fathers Have Set.</p>
                        <p>Our Fathers Are The Prophets And Apostles That Give Birth To The Ages And The True Churches Within Each Age.</p>
                        <p>Scriptures Tell Us Acts 3:25	We Are The Children Of The Prophets, And Of The Covenant Which God Made With Our Fathers, And Are Built Upon Landmarks [The Foundation] Of The Apostles And Prophets, Jesus Christ Himself Being The Chief Corner Stone; Ephesians 2and20 </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>Deu 4:1-2 Now Therefore Hearken, O Israel, Unto The Statutes And Unto The Judgments, Which I Teach You, For To Do Them, That Ye May Live, And Go In And Possess The Land Which The Lord God Of Your Fathers Giveth You.</p>
    
                        <p>(2) Ye Shall Not Add Unto The Word Which I Command You, Neither Shall Ye Diminish Ought From It, [The Landmarks] That Ye May Keep The Commandments Of The Lord Your God Which I Command You.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Landmarks Was Taught By The Apostles And The Elders To The Local Churches – This Is The Apostolic Way To Help Teach The Landmarks Which The Prophet Brought - </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>Acts 16:4	†	And As They Went Through The Cities, They Delivered Them The Decrees For To Keep, That Were Ordained Of The Apostles And Elders Which Were At Jerusalem.</p>
                        
                        <p>Therefore, Adding And Taking Away From The Message Or Apostolic Doctrine Is To Remove The Ancient Landmark For Thyself Or Thy Neighbor – Because We Are Our Neighbor’s Keeper</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>The First Ephesians Had Their Landmark Removed – And Mal 4: 5-6 Is To Restore The Landmark For The Last Day Ephesian Bride</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>In The Message "Father.The.Hour.Has.Come"_ 1962 Chicago.Il -</p> 
                        <p>The Prophet Said "</p>
                        <p> E-16	God Will Bless Anyone Who Will Go Back To The Old Landmark Of The Bible And Start From The Bible, Not According To Theology,--Or Some Man-Made Theology, But From True Bible Theology, And Start From The Old Landmark And Move Up, God Will Move With You". </p>
                        <p>The Landmark Set By The Prophets And Apostles Were The Message And Doctrines Taught By The Holy Spirit. To Remove Or Adjust These Absolute Landmarks Is To Release A Curse Upon Thy Self And Thy People.
                        </p> 
                        <br />
                        <h4>Here Moses Wrote About The Curse Of Removing Landmarks<h4>
                        <p> Deuteronomy
                        27:17	†	Cursed Be He That Removeth His Neighbour's Landmark. And All The People Shall Say, Amen.</p>
                        <p>And Paul Wrote About The Curse And Removing The Landmark<br>
                        <br />
                        Gal 1:6-8 I Marvel That Ye Are So Soon Removed From Him That Called You Into The Grace Of Christ Unto Another Gospel:<br>
                        
                        7	Which Is Not Another; But There Be Some That Trouble You, And Would Pervert The Gospel Of Christ. <br>
                        
                        8	But Though We, Or An Angel From Heaven, Preach Any Other Gospel Unto You Than That Which We Have Preached Unto You, Let Him Be Accursed.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>In The Message " 60- God's.Provided.Way.Of.Approach.To.Fellowship_ </p>
                        The Prophet Said " <br>
                        « E-59	But Today, Our Men, Our Women Are Getting Away From That. They're Get Away From The Old Fashioned Landmarks We Used To Go By. You Ought To Get Back To That Old Pentecostal Landmark.</p>
                        <br />
                        <h4>Here Again The Scriptures Warns Us That - We Must Not Listen To False Preachers - Who Remove God’s Landmark- Less We Come Under The Curse<h4>
                        
                        <p>Pro 19:27 Cease, My Son, To Hear The Instruction That Causeth To Err From The Words Of Knowledge.<br>
                        
                        Mal 4 Restores The Ancient Landmark Of The Apostolic Fathers Faith – And Taught Us To Only Listen To A Certain Vindicated Sound – And To Declare War To Uncertain Sound – He Called Us Out And Delivered Us From The Curse And The Mark Of The Beast That Is To Strike The Earth.</p>
                        <br />
                        <h3>Br Bill Cause Us To Remember Our Ancient Landmarks & "Remember The LORD"<h3>
                        <br />
                        <p> Mal 4:4-6 Remember Ye The Law Of Moses My Servant, Which I Commanded Unto Him In Horeb For All Israel, With The Statutes And Judgments.<br> (5) Behold, I Will Send You Elijah The Prophet [To Restore & Cause US To Remember] Before The Coming Of The Great And Dreadful Day Of The Lord:<br>
                        
                        (6) And He Shall Turn The Heart [To Restore & Cause US To Remember] Of The Fathers To The Children, And The Heart Of The Children To Their Fathers, Lest I Come And Smite The Earth With A Curse. </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>In The Message<b> 56- Father.The.Hour.Has.Come</b> _<br> The Prophet Said<br> « E-
                        58	†	The Time Has Come That God Will Gather His Church Together Through Under One Great Big Banner Of The Lord Jesus Christ And Pour Out His Powers Among Them. ..Ed.<br>
                        The Time Has Come To Go Back To The Old Landmark. The Time Has Come For The Outpouring. The Time Has Come For The Gathering Of The People. The Time Has Come For Jesus To Come. The Time Will Be Here Soon To Give Out The Rewards.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>Now, As We All Are Aware, The Natural Always Types The Spiritual, Thus We Find That In The Spiritual Realms, Boundaries And Limits Are Also Set.<br>
                        <br />
                        Everything In Life Operates Within Boundaries. From The Time We Are Born, Boundaries Are Already Set By Nature And Our Parents.<br>
                    <p>Our Parents, Elders, Community And Schooling System, Set Boundaries For Our Conduct, Order And Doctrine [Behavioral Instruction And Pattern], And We Don’t Have Full Rights Until We Come Of Full Age. Yes Our Rights Are Limited.<br>
                        Parental Boundaries Must To Be Respected In Order To Enjoy The Full Blessings Of God, So That… “Your Days On Earth Shall Be Long”,</p>
                        <br />
                        Also Stated In Proverbs 22:4 By Humility And The Fear Of The Lord Are Riches, And Honor, And Life. This Is One Of The Keys To Life<br>
                        In The Real Estate Domain, Every Property Has A Title Deed And Has Identifiable Boundaries Which Are The Landmarks, Where In, The Full Right Of Ownership Can Be Exercised.<br>
                        To Encroach On Another Man’s Property Is An Offense And Penalties Are Imposed By Authorities For Such Transgressions.</p> <br>
                        <p>In The Political And Social Spheres, We Again See The Imposition Of Boundaries. <br>
                        America’s Boundary Is The Constitution Which Was Based On The Word Of God And Functioned Originally On The Principles Of The Bible. </p><br>
                        <br />
                        <p>Unfortunately, They Progressively Began Crossing These Boundaries, They Have Moved And Continue To Move The Landmarks Of Their Founding Fathers. So Much So That The Current Political Parties Are Propagating And Subscribing To Everything That Is Anti-Word And Anti-Americanism. -. </p>
                        <br />
                        This Has Brought The Curse Upon Themselves [America], Even To The Place That God's Prophet Refuse To Prayer For America. They Removed The Ancient Landmarks Of Their Founding Fathers, And Have Brought The Curse And Judgment Upon Themselves.<br>
                        Remember How Ham Crossed The Boundary Of His Father As The Scripture Declares “And Ham, The Father Of Canaan, Saw The Nakedness Of His Father,” (Gen 9:22). For This, His Grandchildren Had To Reap The Wrath Of God. </p>
                        <br />
                        
                        
                        By God’s Grace, We Have Leant The Importance Of God Revealing Himself Through Concepts, Principles, Laws, Etc. </p>
                    <p> And Thus We Know That The Above Pattern Is Even More Relevant And Applicable To His Bride. <br>
                        His Boundary For Us Is In The Revealed Word For This Hour. I Thus Want To Encourage All Elders, Ministers And Members In Our Sister Churches To Keep To The Boundaries God Laid Out In His Word And Never To Deviate One Iota From It.
                        </p> <br>
                        
                        <p>May We All Acknowledge And Recognize That We're Loved Of Our Father, We Are A Called And Separated People, Born Under A Nazarite Vow, And That We Are The Justified “Sinless, Virtuous Bride Of Jesus Christ.” .. What Grace!
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        
                    <p>Now! We Must Unite & Stand Together Against All That Oppose Our Landmarks, Let us Be Fearless When Confronted By Philistine Circumstances, Remembering & Believing That All Things Work For Good To Them That Love The Lord. <br>
                        Let's Walk Circumspectly Before The Lord And To Be Under Great Expectation In The Coming Year. <br
                        May The Lord Bless You, Cause His Face To Shine Upon You And Grant You Much Grace In This New Year Is My Prayer, For You All. </p>
